This project is a 3-storey car park tracking system. The top floor will be made with a linked list, and 
Josephâ€™s Chip will be applied. With the Josephus method, it will jump in the number of users entered and
 remove the selected car of the link list and add it to the lower floor, and this list will continue until 
the linked list is empty, but the process from the next car of the car that is removed will continue, so there 
will be no freezing event in every removal process. There will be a tail structure in the middle floor on the 
ground floor and cars will be removed with the FIFO method, but with each 50% chance after the vehicle is removed, 
1 car from the top floor of 1 floor will be included at the end of the queue. 
In the lowest floor, basement, the vehicles will be kept in stack form and LIFO will be applied. 
Our park lot takes a maximum of 45 vehicles and the number of vehicles per floor is 15. 
The program will end when the vehicles are finished.
